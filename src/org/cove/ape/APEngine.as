TODO:
- collidible SpringConstraints should have their own collection controlled from within the
  add/remove constraint methods here -- so collision checks dont involve non-collidable
  constraints.
- need a removeForces method
- container should be automatic, but settable
- globally, change all internal getters to directly access properties, for performance.
  its better to break encapsulation within the library (not the public interface),
  rather than suffer the performance hit -- although it would be worth it to review
  just how slow the getters are in as3
